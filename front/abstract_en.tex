	Smartfarm in greenhouse is an advanced agricultural system that integrates
	smart technologies and data analytics to optimize crop growth and yield in a
	controlled environment. The proposed system uses a network of sensors and
	monitoring devices to collect data on various environmental parameters such
	as temperature, humidity and light intensity. All these collected data are then analyzed in order to produce crop growth patterns. 
	This Smartfarm proposed sytem is designed to provide real-time feedback to farmers and
	greenhouse managers, allowing them to make informed decisions about crop
	management. The proposed system also provides remote access to monitor
	and control the environment, such as adjusting temperature and humidity
	levels, and ensuring optimal growing conditions.
